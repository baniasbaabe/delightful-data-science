## Why this Book exists

The story starts in December 2022 when I started writing daily LinkedIn posts sharing one short Python/Data Science tip per day. My main goal was to share what I learnt over the years with others. I thought "When it's useful for me, it will be probably useful for other people too".

As time went by, more and more people found the tips useful. Soon, I realized that these daily tips could be compiled into a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in becoming better Data Scientist.

Thus, the idea for "Delightful Data Science" was born. The book contains all the tips shared by the author on LinkedIn, as well as many more to come in the future.

## Small Code Snippets, Big Upgrade

The book is called "Delightful Data Science" because it aims to make your data science journey more delightful by helping you become a better Data Scientist. By incorporating these tips and tricks into your workflow, you can make your Data Science projects more enjoyable and successful.
