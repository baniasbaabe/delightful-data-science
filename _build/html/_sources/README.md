## Why this Book exists

It was December 2022 when I started writing daily LinkedIn posts sharing one short Python/Data Science tip per day. My main goal was to share what I learnt over the years (and what I am currently learning) with others. I thought "When it's useful for me, it will be probably useful for other people too".

As time went by, more and more people found the tips useful. Soon, I realized that these daily tips could be compiled into a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in becoming better Data Scientist.

Thus, the idea for "Python & Chill" was born. The book contains all the tips shared by the author on LinkedIn, as well as many more to come in the future.
